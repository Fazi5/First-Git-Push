    <h2>What are www websites:</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p1>A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment or social networking. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. As of May 2023, the top 5 most visited websites are Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.<br><br> Publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees. Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a web browser.</p1>
<h3>Background:</h3>
<p1>The World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1989 by the British CERN computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone, contributing to the immense growth of the Web. Before the introduction of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple directory structure in which the user navigates and where they choose files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting or were encoded in word processor formats.</p1>
<h3>History:</h3>
<p1>While "web site" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized "Web site", since "Web" is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide Web), this variant has become rarely used, and "website" has become the standard spelling. All major style guides, such as The Chicago Manual of Style and the AP Stylebook, have reflected this change.<br><br>In February 2009, Netcraft, an Internet monitoring company that has tracked Web growth since 1995, reported that there were 215,675,903 websites with domain names and content on them in 2009, compared to just 19,732 websites in August 1995. After reaching 1 billion websites in September 2014, a milestone confirmed by Netcraft in its October 2014 Web Server Survey and that Internet Live Stats was the first to announce—as attested by this tweet from the inventor of the World Wide Web himself, Tim Berners-Lee—the number of websites in the world have subsequently declined, reverting to a level below 1 billion. This is due to the monthly fluctuations in the count of inactive websites. The number of websites continued growing to over 1 billion by March 2016 and has continued growing since. Netcraft Web Server Survey in January 2020 reported that there are 1,295,973,827 websites and in April 2021 reported that there are 1,212,139,815 sites across 10,939,637 web-facing computers, and 264,469,666 unique domains. An estimated 85 percent of all websites are inactive.</p1>

<h3>how to design websites:</h3>
<p2>Designing websites involves a multifaceted process that integrates both aesthetic and functional considerations. Begin by defining the purpose and goals of your website, identifying your target audience, and setting clear objectives. Plan the content structure by creating a sitemap and organizing information logically. Choose a design concept that aligns with your brand, selecting appropriate colors, typography, and imagery to convey the desired mood. Create wireframes and high-fidelity mockups to visualize the layout and design elements. Implement responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices. Write clean and semantic HTML, apply CSS for styling, and incorporate interactivity using JavaScript where needed. Prioritize user-friendly navigation, optimize images and content for faster loading times, and conduct thorough testing across browsers and devices. Implement SEO best practices for better visibility on search engines.<br><br>
     After launch, regularly update content, monitor analytics, and stay informed about evolving design trends and technologies.

<h3>How to create websites:</h3>
<p1>Creating a website involves several steps, and it can be broken down into a series of tasks that encompass planning, design, development, and deployment. To initiate the process, you should clearly define the purpose and goals of your website. Identify your target audience and establish specific objectives that align with your vision.
    <br><br>
    Once you've outlined your goals, proceed to plan the content of your website. Develop a sitemap to organize the structure and hierarchy of your pages. Consider creating a content strategy that reflects the needs and interests of your target audience.
    <br><br>
    Selecting a domain name and a reliable web hosting provider is the next step. Your domain name should be unique, relevant to your content, and easy to remember. Choose a hosting provider that meets your technical requirements and provides a stable environment for your website.
    <br><br>
    Decide on a website building platform that suits your needs. Content management systems (CMS) like WordPress offer user-friendly interfaces, while building from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides more control over customization.
    <br><br>
    Designing your website involves creating wireframes and mockups for the layout. Consider the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly design. Choose color schemes, fonts, and imagery that align with your brand.
    <br><br>
    When it comes to development, write the HTML for your website's structure, apply CSS for styling, and add JavaScript for interactivity. Test your website across different browsers to ensure compatibility and fix any issues that may arise.
    <br><br>
    Ensure your website is responsive to various devices and screen sizes. Optimize it for search engines by implementing on-page SEO techniques, using proper meta tags, headers, and image alt attributes.
    <br><br>
    Add necessary functionality, such as forms, contact pages, or e-commerce features. Conduct thorough testing to ensure everything works correctly before launching your website. Upload your files to the hosting server and register your site with search engines.
    <br><br>
    After the launch, monitor and update your content regularly. Keep an eye on website analytics and address any issues promptly. Implement security measures to protect your website and stay informed about web development trends, updating your site as needed.

<h1>Languages to Code Websites in So Far Learned:</h1>
<h2>HTML:</h2>
<img src="th (1).jpeg"style="float:right"width="150">
<p1>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating webpages. It uses tags to structure content, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML provides a hierarchical structure for organizing information, and it includes semantic elements that convey meaning about the content. With tags and attributes, HTML allows for the creation of hyperlinks, embedding images, and building forms for user interaction. It is a foundational technology in web development, often used alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML, along with its complementary technologies, forms the basis of the World Wide Web.</p1>
<h2>Css:</h2>
<img src="th (2).jpeg"style="float:right"width="150">
<p1>Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is a crucial component in web development that defines the visual presentation and layout of HTML or XML documents. It serves to separate the structure and content of a webpage (handled by HTML) from its styling and visual aspects. Using CSS, developers can target HTML elements through selectors and apply a set of declarations to control properties like color, font, spacing, and positioning. CSS operates on a rule-based system, where selectors specify the elements to be styled, and declarations outline the desired appearance. Selectors can be based on element types, classes, IDs, attributes, or relationships between elements. The CSS box model governs the layout, including properties for content, padding, border, and margin.
<br><br>
    Additionally, CSS facilitates the creation of responsive designs, allowing web pages to adapt to various screen sizes and devices. This is achieved through media queries that apply specific styles based on conditions such as screen width. With its versatility, CSS plays a key role in enhancing the user experience, enabling developers to create visually appealing, consistent, and user-friendly interfaces across different browsers and devices.</p1>
